  # Account Validation

  This endpoint validates a user account using the token received via email during registration.

  ## Request Body

  - `token` (string, required): The account validation token received via email

  ## Response

  Returns a success message when the account is validated successfully.

  ```json
  {
    "message": "Account validated successfully. Your account is now active and you can log in."
  }
  ```

  ## Workflow

  1. User registers via `/auth/register`
  2. System sends validation email with token
  3. User clicks validation link or calls this endpoint
  4. Account is activated (`emailConfirmed = true`)
  5. User can now log in via `/auth/login`

  ## Security Features

  - Token expires after 24 hours
  - Token is single-use only
  - Account remains inactive until validation
  - Users cannot log in without validation

  ## Error Responses

  - **Invalid Token**: If the token is invalid or expired
  - **Already Confirmed**: If the account is already validated
